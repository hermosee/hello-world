My first repository

Hello Everyone!

Esteban here, I like to introduce myself as a super beginner programmer. Currently I am a Support Engineer and I want to use Python as my first and preferred coding language. I want to become a System Developer Engineer and use coding to automate my everyday work as a starter project.
